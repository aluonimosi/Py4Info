Write a program to read through the mail box data and when you
find line that starts with “From”, you will split the line into words using the split
function. We are interested in who sent the message, which is the second word on
the From line.

fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
lst = []
output = []
count = 0

for line in fhand:
    if line.startswith('From:'):
        continue
    if line.startswith('From'):
        line = line.rstrip()
        lst.append(line)

for i in lst:
    i = i.split(" ")
    if not i[1] in output:
        output.append(i[1])
        print(i[1])
        count = count + 1
        
print('there are', count,'addresses found')
