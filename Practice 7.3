#Exercise 7.3 Sometimes when programmers get bored or want to have a bit of fun,
they add a harmless Easter Egg to their program (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Easter_egg_(media)). Modify the program that prompts the user for the file
name so that it prints a funny message when the user types in the exact file name
“na na boo boo”. The program should behave normally for all other files which
exist and don’t exist.

fname = input('enter the file name')
count = 0

if fname == 'Nana':
    print('you punk')

else:
    try:
        fhand = open(fname)
    except:
        print('cannot find the file, please enter a correct name')

    for i in fhand:
        count = count+1

    print(count)
