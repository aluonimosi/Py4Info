Exercise 9.1 Write a program that reads the words in words.txt and stores them
as keys in a dictionary. It doesnâ€™t matter what the values are. Then you can use
the in operator as a fast way to check whether a string is in the dictionary.

fhand = open('output.txt')
dic = dict()
lst = list()

for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    line = line.split()
    for word in line:
        lst.append(word)

for i in lst:
    dic[i]=0

print (dic)
