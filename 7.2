Write a program to prompt for a file name, and then read through
the file and look for lines of the form:
X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475

fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
count = 0
lst = []

for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if line.find('X-DSPAM-Confidence') == -1:
        continue
    count = count + 1
    line = float(line.split(' ')[1])
    lst.append(line)
    print (line)
print('there are',count, 'lines of target data')

print(lst)

num = 0
for i in lst:
    num = num + i

print('the average of the list is :', num/len(lst))
